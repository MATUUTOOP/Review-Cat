# DirectorDev agent spec

## Overview

The DirectorDev agent coordinates development of the ReviewCat codebase by managing role agents (implementer, QA, docs, security, code-review).

This is intended to be implemented using Copilot CLI custom agents and a thin orchestration wrapper.

## Requirements

1. Must operate spec-first: implementation tasks must reference a spec file.
2. Must coordinate role agents in a predictable order.
3. Must run build/test after implementation.
4. Must record a development audit bundle.

## Interfaces

- Entry: `dev/harness/director.sh` (heartbeat daemon) or manual `dev/harness/run-cycle.sh <task> <spec>`
- Artifact output: `dev/audits/<audit_id>/`

Role agents are defined under `.github/agents/` and `dev/agents/` as markdown
prompt files, invoked via `copilot -p @dev/agents/<role>.md "..."`.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a spec, DirectorDev produces:
  - code changes implementing acceptance criteria
  - tests
  - updated docs
  - a prompt ledger

## Test cases

- Run DirectorDev in replay mode (no Copilot calls) using fixtures.

## Edge cases

- Spec incomplete or ambiguous.
- A role agent produces conflicting recommendations.

## Non-functional constraints

- Scope control: DirectorDev must refuse to expand scope beyond spec unless explicitly authorized.
- Safety: no network actions without opt-in.
- Logging: every heartbeat iteration logged via `dev/harness/log.sh`.
- MCP Server is configured via either remote MCP or a native `github-mcp-server stdio` binary (host or container-bundled).
