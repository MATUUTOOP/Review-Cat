# Spec name

## Overview

What this spec covers and why it exists.

## Requirements

Numbered requirements. These should be testable.

## Interfaces

Public surface area.

- CLI flags
- functions
- files written
- JSON schemas

## Acceptance criteria

A checklist of conditions that must be true for the implementation to be considered complete.

> Governance note: if this spec changes swarm behavior (workflow/protocol/roles),
> ensure the change is reflected in `AGENT.md` and any related planning issues.

## Location

ReviewCat is migrating to a **two-track** docs structure:

- Dev harness docs/specs: `docs/dev/` and `docs/dev/specs/`
- Runtime app docs/specs: `docs/app/` and `docs/app/specs/`

Legacy specs still exist under `docs/specs/` during migration.
If you are creating a new spec, prefer placing it under the appropriate dev/app spec tree.

## Test cases

Concrete tests that map 1:1 to acceptance criteria.

## Edge cases

Unusual inputs and failure modes.

## Non-functional constraints

Performance, determinism, security, UX constraints.
