# Specs Index

Specs live under `docs/specs/` and are organized by **concern**:

- **Dev harness specs** (agents + harness systems): [`docs/specs/dev/SPECS.md`](dev/SPECS.md)
- **Runtime app specs** (components/entities/systems): [`docs/specs/app/SPECS.md`](app/SPECS.md)

## Directories

- Dev harness specs: `docs/specs/dev/`
- Runtime app specs: `docs/specs/app/`

## Creating new specs

Place new specs under the appropriate subtree:

- `docs/specs/dev/` for dev harness concerns
- `docs/specs/app/` for runtime app concerns

Use the template at [`docs/specs/_template.md`](_template.md).
