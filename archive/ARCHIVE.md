# Archive

This directory stores per-release snapshots of project planning artifacts that would otherwise grow without bound.

## TODO.md archival

At the start of each release cycle, move the previous `TODO.md` into this directory and rename it with a timestamp or release tag, for example:

- `archive/TODO-2026-02-11.md`
- `archive/TODO-v0.3.0.md`

The active `TODO.md` should remain focused on the current release. Archived TODOs may be searched for context, but current work should trace to open issues and the active TODO.
