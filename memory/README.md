# /memory — Shared Engram Store (Tracked)

This directory contains **durable shared agent memory** as versioned, structured **engram DTOs**.

## Why this exists

- The swarm produces a high-volume stream of agent-bus events (heartbeats, errors, state changes, decisions).
- Keeping shared memory in a single frequently-updated tracked file does not scale across parallel worktrees.
- Instead, older event slices are compacted into **engram files** that can be committed, reviewed, merged, and fetched like normal repo artifacts.

## Structure

The shared durable memory layout is intentionally **append-friendly** and **merge-friendly**.

- `memory/catalog.json` — the authoritative **EngramCatalogDTO** (Director-maintained LUT)
- `memory/st/<batch_id>/engram_<engram_id>.json` — short-term engrams (recent, high relevance)
- `memory/lt/<batch_id>/engram_<engram_id>.json` — long-term engrams (stable conventions and lessons)

In addition to these durable engrams, the repo root contains:

- `MEMORY.md` — a **tracked, bounded shared focus view** maintained by the Director and derived from recent high-signal ST/LT context.

### Naming rules (normative)

- `<batch_id>` MUST be a UTC timestamp:
	- format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSZ` (example: `20260211-231715Z`)
	- used as the **directory name** and should match the EngramDTO `version`
- `<engram_id>` MUST be filename-safe and stable.
	- recommended: a ULID with an `e_` prefix (example: `e_01J1Z2K3M4N5P6Q7R8S9T0V1W2`)
	- allowed characters: `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -`

```

> Note: we intentionally standardize on timestamp batch ids (not release tags) to keep directory ordering predictable and avoid ambiguous sorting.

## Governance

- Engrams should be treated as **append-only** once merged (prefer new versions over edits).
- The Director maintains an authoritative **engram catalog (LUT)** mapping ids → hashes/paths/versions.
- Workers should stay in sync with `main` to pull the latest engrams into their worktrees.

- `config/dev.toml` `[memory]` keys
