## 📝 What is Review-Cat?

Review-Cat is a tool designed to help you check your software code for mistakes and improvements automatically. It works on its own to find issues in programming code and suggests fixes. This makes reviewing code easier and faster, giving you clear feedback without needing special technical knowledge.

The tool is built to handle software that uses modern C++ language features, which programmers call C++17. If you want to improve the quality of code in your projects or make patching mistakes simpler, Review-Cat can help.

## 📂 How to Use Review-Cat

Review-Cat works by analyzing code files to find issues and suggest corrections. Here is how you can use it step-by-step:

   Launch the application from your computer’s menu.
