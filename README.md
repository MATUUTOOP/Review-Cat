# ReviewCat

**Autonomous AI-powered code review daemon** — uses GitHub Copilot CLI to
provide persona-based code review, unified synthesis, and optional patch
automation for any Git repository.

ReviewCat is also **self-building**: a development harness powered by Copilot
CLI autonomously develops, tests, and iterates on its own codebase.

The workflow is intentionally cyclic:

> **bootstrap → dev → app → dev → app → …**

## Project Status (Docs-first → Code)

This repository is currently **planning/specs-first**: the docs and specs are the
source of truth, and the implementation is being bootstrapped in Phase 0.

- The planned scaffold (`app/`, `dev/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`) is **not fully
	present yet**.
- The next milestone is to create the minimal repo scaffold + a “green”
	build/test gate so autonomous cycles can run end-to-end.

Tracking issue: **#16 — _Bootstrap Repo Scaffold + Green Build/Test Gate_**.

## Key Features

- **Persona-based review** — Security, performance, architecture, testing, and docs agents.
- **Unified synthesis** — Deduplicated, prioritized findings in markdown + JSON.
- **Audit trail** — Every Copilot CLI call recorded in a prompt ledger.
- **GitHub integration** — PR comments, issues, and patches via GitHub MCP Server.
- **Daemon mode** — Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals.
- **Native UI** — SDL3-based UI surfaces (settings, stats, control) and an optional 3D swarm visualizer.
- **Self-building** — Director daemon (Agent 0) that orchestrates development.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Language | C++17/20 |
| Build system | CMake |
| Dev harness | Bash shell scripts |
| UI | SDL3 (window/input) + custom ToolUI (primitives + bitmap glyph font + hex colors) + optional 3D swarm visualizer |
| Copilot integration | `copilot -p` subprocess |
| GitHub integration | GitHub MCP Server (remote MCP recommended; native binary or containerized for dev harness) |
| JSON | nlohmann/json |
| Config | TOML (toml++) |
| Testing | Catch2 |
| Logging | spdlog (C++), structured bash logging (dev) |
| Git | libgit2 + `gh` CLI |

**Current structure (today):** docs/specs + planning files + `config/dev.toml`.
See [TODO.md](TODO.md) Phase 0 and Issue #16 for the bootstrapping path.

## Quick Start (after Phase 0 scaffold exists)

> Note: the commands below assume Phase 0 scaffolding has been implemented.
> If you’re looking for what to do right now, start with [TODO.md](TODO.md)
> Phase 0 and Issue #16.

```bash
# Prerequisites: CMake, C++17 compiler, Copilot CLI, gh CLI
# Dev harness prereq (recommended/required for autonomous loop): Docker (WSL2-friendly)

# Clone
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/Review-Cat.git
cd Review-Cat

# Install system prereqs (gh, jq, github-mcp-server)
./dev/scripts/setup.sh

# Build
./scripts/build.sh

# Run demo (no auth required)
./build/reviewcat demo

# Review local changes
./build/reviewcat review

# Review a PR
./build/reviewcat pr 42 --repo OWNER/REPO

# Start daemon mode
./build/reviewcat watch --interval 60

# Open UI
./build/reviewcat ui
```

## Development (Self-Building)

The **dev harness** (once implemented) assumes a Docker-capable environment
(Linux, or Windows + WSL2 + Docker Desktop integration): one shared image tag,
many worker containers, one git worktree mounted per worker.

The Director’s scheduling, timeouts, worker telemetry, and agent-bus networking are configured via `config/dev.toml`.

Project memory is shared in two layers (see `AGENT.md` and Issue #13):

- **Durable engrams** committed under `/memory/` (with `memory/catalog.json` as the authoritative LUT and engrams stored in timestamped batches)
- A **shared, bounded focus view** (`MEMORY.md`, tracked) maintained by the Director and derived from recent high-signal ST/LT context

The development harness runs autonomously via the Director daemon (once the
Phase 0 scaffold + scripts exist):

```bash
# Install system prereqs
./dev/scripts/setup.sh

# Bootstrap dev environment
./dev/scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Start Director daemon (Agent 0)
./dev/harness/director.sh
```

The Director reads `dev/plans/prd.json`, delegates to Copilot CLI role agents,
validates via build + test, and commits. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) §5 for details.

## Specs

All specs live under `docs/specs/`:

- `docs/specs/components/` — Pure data structures
- `docs/specs/entities/` — Factories and construction rules
- `docs/specs/systems/` — Modules with logic and side-effects
- `docs/specs/agents/` — Copilot CLI custom agents and role workflows

Development is spec-first: update or add a spec, then implement to match
acceptance criteria.
